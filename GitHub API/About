This project lists the users with read access to a repository in an organisation. 
It uses shell scripts and GitHub API to automate this routine task of engineers, which makes their workloads lighter.
This also helps enhance security to the organisation's repository.

This project demonstrates my skills in shell scripting and API keys.

The code will be continuously updates and improved on further learning.
